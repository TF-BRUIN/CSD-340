			<p class="intro">
				Hello, my name is Truman Forey. I grew up here in Bellevue, Omaha and
				I've lived here all my life. I'm currently 24 years old, my birthday
				is May 12th, and I was born in the year <span id="blank1">_____</span>.

			</button>

			<p>
				Right now, I'm currently studying software development as my major in
				Bellevue University. My ultimate goal is to become a video game
				developer. I believe having a degree in general software 
				development will allow me to transition into that industry easily. At the
				moment, I'm currently building my own game in the <span id="blank2">
				_______</span> game engine using <span id="blank3">_________</span>.

			<button type="button"
				onclick="document.getElementById('blank3').innerHTML = addPython">
				Fill in Blank #3
			</button>
			<br>
			<p>
				Outside of my career, I live with my family and my pet cat,
				<span id="blank4">_________</span>. I moved out during the entirety of
				2024, but I moved back in to help save money until I graduate
				in 2026. It's not an easy situation, but I'm sure I will
				get through it.
