	<p class="intro">Hello, my name is Truman Forey. I grew up here in Bellevue, Omaha and I've lived here all my life. I'm currently 24 years old, my birthday is May 12th, and I was born in the year 2000.
</p>
	<p>Right now, I'm currently studying software development as my major in Bellevue University. <span class="sentence">My ultimate goal is to become a video game developer.</span> I beleve having a degree in general software development will allow me to transition into that industry easily. At the moment, I'm currently building my own game in the Godot game engine using Python.</p>
	<p>Outside of my career, I live with my family and my pet cat, Camilla. I moved out during the entirety of 2024, but I moved back in to help save money until I graduate in 2026. It's not an easy situation, but I'm sure I will get through it.</p>
